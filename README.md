# AGM-API
API to perform CRUD operations through RESTful principles. This project began as a side project, evolved into my senior capstone project, and (possibly) will evolve into a SaaS side business. 

## Why am I releasing the source code?
Most of my software engineering work is found in proprietary code bases at my current job, thus before this project I didn't have much to show in the form of source code I've developed. My previous projects on my repo were either school projects, or side projects from when I was in high school (or earlier)
