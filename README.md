# AGM-API
API to perform CRUD operations through RESTful principles. This project began as a side project, evolved into my senior capstone project, and (possibly) will evolve into a SaaS side business. 

## Code style
Throughout the code base there will be commented out sections of code, implementations that are less than optimal, and some shortcuts I've taken. This is not representative of the final product, nor what I consider to be product-ready software. This project has some portions that are in a "prototype" phase, and other portions that are more polished. In a team-based enviornment, such differences would be broken up into multiple projects. However as I am the only member of my capstone thesis group, this workflow has proven to be faster and more efficient for myself.

## Why am I releasing the source code?
Most of my software engineering work is found in proprietary code bases at my current job, thus before this project I didn't have much to show in the form of source code I've developed. My previous projects on my repo were either school projects, or side projects from when I was in high school (or earlier).

## Why am I not using an ORM such as Hibernate?
ORMs are a great abstraction tool, and I've used Hibernate breifly in the past, however for the applications at work, the ORM was rather limiting for what we needed to achieve. In regards to this project, I want to learn more about PostgreSQL, as most of my experience has been with MSSQL, and MySQL. Using an ORM abstracts many of the nuances inherit in each RDBMS language implementation, which is great for productivity, but less so for understanding the fundamentals the RDMS offers.
